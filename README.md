# Email Campaign Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

## Project Overview

This dashboard provides a detailed analysis of email marketing campaign performance over a three-month period (July–September 2024). It offers key insights into when audiences are most engaged, which content types perform best, how different client segments behave, and which regions contribute most to conversions. Built in Power BI, the dashboard transforms raw engagement metrics into actionable visualizations to support marketing strategy, UX optimization, and audience targeting. It enables campaign managers to identify high-impact sending times, optimize content design, and refine audience segmentation to improve open, click, and conversion rates.

## Recommendations

### Campaign Timing
- Focus email delivery on mid-week days, which consistently demonstrate higher open and click rates. These align better with user behavior and inbox-checking patterns.
- Avoid weekend sends, especially Sundays as engagement significantly drops due to reduced screen time and work related attention.
- Maintain a consistent send schedule whicha re same time and day each week to improve familiarity and support long-term open rate performance.
- Avoid over sending, as high campaign frequency correlates with higher unsubscribe rates. Saturated segments should be managed carefully to protect list health.

### Campaign Content Strategy
- Continue prioritizing Events, Webinars, and Newsletters, as these consistently yield the highest conversion results.
- Use visual storytelling to enhance emotional connection and brand recall. Visuals are processed up to 60,000x faster than text and improve engagement.
- Optimize CTA buttons by:
  - Placing CTAs in clear, prominent areas  
  - Using contrasting colors to draw attention  
  - Applying action-oriented language like “Download Now” or “Get Your Guide”
- Implement A/B testing to validate subject lines, CTA designs, and layout decisions—ensuring the best-performing variants are prioritized.

### Audience Targeting
- Prioritize Leads in campaign targeting—they deliver stronger click and conversion rates and present better ROI potential.
- Reevaluate the Promotional campaign strategy, which showed the lowest engagement. Revise messaging, design, or targeting to improve relevance.
- Focus efforts on high-performing countries like Iceland, Vanuatu, and Guinea. Simultaneously, exclude or clean underperforming segments with high bounce rates to improve deliverability.

### Device Experience & UX Optimization
- With over 61% of clicks from desktop, ensure landing pages are optimized for fast loading, clean design, and intuitive layout.
- Improve landing page quality by:
  - Ensuring SEO-optimized, original, and relevant content  
  - Highlighting unique selling propositions (USPs) early  
  - Using trust signals (testimonials, contact info, security icons)  
  - Simplifying navigation and reducing visual clutter

### Conversion Goal Design
- Continue promoting Web Visits and Sign-Ups, which currently show the highest success rates.
- Redesign or test new approaches for lower performing goals like Form Completions and Downloads consider shorter forms, clearer CTA text, and better-aligned landing pages.
- Tailor messaging and CTA design based on goal type to ensure better alignment between user intent and experience.

### List Hygiene & Email Deliverability
- Audit and clean contact lists from high-bounce campaigns like Product Workshop (July) and After Event Follow-Up to improve sender reputation.
- Replicate formatting, tone, and send timing from low bounce campaigns like Drip3 Licensing to enhance inbox placement.
- Monitor unsubscribe behavior in countries with high opt-out rates (e.g., Kosovo, Lebanon). Consider reducing frequency or changing tone for these regions.

### High Open, Low Click Campaigns
- Investigate campaigns like September, which showed strong open performance but low click through rates often due to weak CTAs or content mismatch.
- Rework layout, message clarity, and CTA visibility on dates like Day 17, 20, and 24 to better convert already-engaged recipients.
